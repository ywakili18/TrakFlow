Trakflow is a bug-tracking tool that utilizes PostgreSQL, Express.js, Node.js for the back-end and the front-end uses React.js as JavaScript library, TailwindCSS for utility-first styling and Framer Motion for screen animations/motions. Trakflow allows the user to create a new ticket called "Traks" that is added and can be tracked through its history.

## Trakflow features:

- Login authentication using JWT tokens
- Users can create new tickets, assigned with their current roles (ex: Jr.Dev, Project Manager)
- Add new updates to tickets and close when ticket is completed
